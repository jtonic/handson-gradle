#### Goals

1. Learning gradle project build tool.
1. See the differences between Gradle and Kotlin DSL Gradle plugin
    1. performance
    1. usability 
    1. stability
    1. feature rich
1. How easy is to extend Gradle with new plugins.

Note: 
1. I am investigating the benefits and drawbacks of gradle vs maven. I would like to have my next projects based on Gradle

Gradle samples:

- buildSrc 


    https://github.com/gradle/gradle/tree/master/subprojects/docs/src/samples/multiProjectBuildSrc/buildSrc 
    
- further samples


    https://github.com/gradle/gradle/tree/master/subprojects/docs/src/samples


Next exercises:

- delete folders in clean after clean task
- create and use simple plugins
- typed tasks (in buildSrc) with input and output (and benefit from cache)
- angular/node/bower project with gradle (migration of timesheet)
- tasks from local file
